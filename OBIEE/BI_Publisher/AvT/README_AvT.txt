AvT - Actual vs Theoretical

The goal of these reports was to analyze restaurant data for critical foods and identify 
which stores were performing best in a given district/region/company when it came to Actual vs Theoretical food usage.
These reports helped identify stores that were wasting more food than their peers so that appropriate adjustments can be made to make 
these stores more efficient again. The reports were bursted on a weekly basis at 4 levels
1. Company level
2. Regional level
3. District level
4. Store level

The food savings from these reports was in the millions as many stores significantly decreased their food waste in a short period of time 
after proper training and adjustments were made at the store. The reports were also cloned for other tracking purposes, such as beverage
tracking.
