The Meat Order Guide report is a report that I built for our stores to help the general manager 
decide on how much meat they should order for the upcoming week based on the last 4 weeks of sales. This report was bursted
on a weekly basis and it helped restaurants order the appropriate amount of proteins backed by sales data.
