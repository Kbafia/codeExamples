The Over Ring reports was a report I built across the 4 levels (Concept, Region, District, Store) that helped audit and accounting 
identify if any fraudulant or excessive voiding/comping activity was occurring in specific stores. Within a month of implementation 
of these reports, audit was able to find and prove suspicious activity occurring in some stores. These reports became a critical 
source of data in investigations and helped enforce integrity among the stores and enterprise.
