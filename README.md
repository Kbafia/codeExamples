# codeExamples
Hello and welcome to my repository.

The purpose of the codeExamples repo is to demonstrate previous work that I have done, or technical questions that I have answered, that I would like to share with you. Many of these examples are either screening questions that were asked of me, or simple practice problems that I answered during my free time. Please note that due to the nature of these problems, they probably aren't the most efficient or eloquent coding examples, and I will do my best to annotate any improvements that could be made but weren't due to essence of time when solving the problems.

The goal of sharing these examples is to demonstrate my technical skillset and eagerness to learn new technologies. If you have any qeustions or would like to get in touch with me, please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/kbafia/.

Thanks!

-Konrad
